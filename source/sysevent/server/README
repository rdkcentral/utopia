The syseventd will listen for client connections on all INADDR_ANY by default, but this
may be changed at compile time by changing syseventd_main.c::LISTEN_IP_ADDR.

It will listen on port 18667 by default, but this can be changed at compile time
by changing lib/sysevent.h:SE_SERVER_WELL_KNOWN_PORT, or at runtime by 
specifying --port on the command line.

The syseventd could reinitialze by sending syseventd the signal
SIGUSR1 except that syseventd doesn't do anything. Feel free to 
think up something useful you could do with a signal handler
